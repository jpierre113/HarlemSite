			Harlem is known internationally as the Black Mecca of the world, but 
			Harlem has been home to many races and ethnic groups including the 
			Dutch, Irish, German, Italian, and Jewish. Harlem was originally 
			settled by the Dutch in 1658, but was largely farmland and 
			undeveloped territory for approximately 200 years. As New York’s 
			population grew, residential and commercial expansion moved 
			northward, and development of the Harlem territory was evitable. Blacks continued to pour into Harlem from points in lower Manhattan, 
			the American South and the Caribbean.&nbsp; Blacks migrated in record numbers from the 
			south to northern cities in search of opportunities and increased 
			wages. During the 1920’s, Harlem flourished with cultural and artistic 
			expression. This period was christened the “Harlem Renaissance”. 
			Harlem Renaissance figures such as Langston Hughes, Aaron Douglas, 
			Alain Locke and others felt that they would use their artistic 
			creativity as a means to show America and the world that Blacks are 
			intellectual, artistic and humane and should be treated accordingly.The Great Depression of 1929 rocked the country and devastated Black 
			communities such as Harlem. The pressure of high rents, unemployment 
			and racist practices cumulated in Harlem riots in 1935 and 1943. (Source: harlemheritage.com)</p>
